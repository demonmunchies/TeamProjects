Generates synthetic temperature data on mongoDB.
Creates 1 year of data from a year before the current time to the current time
in one minute increments.
NOTES: TAKES LONG TO RUN ON SOME COMPUTERS. MAKE SURE IT FINISHES.
- Make sure to create a db called 'test' on the mongoDB server, and a collection call 'tempStats.'
- See notes on insertion code for help with this part.
